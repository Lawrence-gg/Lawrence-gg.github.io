                    <p>
                        Neuroplasticity, initially theorized from the late 1800s, relates to the malleability of the
                        brain and its ability to constantly change and adapt from day to day experience. By actively
                        engaging the brain in undertaking new learning, thought and information we can actively form new
                        neural pathways and build connections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Traditionally, this plasticity was thought to occur only during childhood, but in more recent
                        years this school of thought has trained significantly, and research has shown that many aspects
                        of the brain are able to be altered throughout adulthood.

                        This can have benefits in treatment and recovery programs for people who have suffered from
                        brain injuries or strokes, as well as forming functional and behavioral tools and strategies to
                        adapt for those who experience conditions such as ADD, Autism or Dyslexia.

                    <p>
                        Conventional school of thought was much along the line that Intelligence was ‘set’ and that
                        there was little that could be done to alter or improve functioning mental capacity. The great
                        news is modern research shows this is far from the truth!
                    </p>

                    <p> Internalised beliefs and attitudes have a big impact on how we perceive ourselves and interact
                        with the world around us.

                    <p>
                        A fixed mindset is one where you believe that qualities like intelligence, skill and ability to
                        improve are relatively set and that is a limited ability to improve.
                        Thoughts such as “Oh I’m not a numbers person, I can’t do that” may be encountered when
                        encountering a problem that requires some mathematical input. The person may believe it is very
                        hard or futile to attempt to improve at that skill, as they are just ‘not good at it’.

                        Growth Mindset
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        A growth mindset welcomes change and embraces challenges. It recognises that we have the ability
                        to adapt, learn and improve and that if we are encountered with a problem that doesn’t feel
                        familiar or comfortable, it is an opportunity to work and improve at that skill. This also
                        swings the other way. A growth mindset realises that skills that are already familiar can still
                        be improved upon and improved to be even better.

                    <p>
                        There are many benefits to cultivating a growth mindset in day to day tasks. How we perceive
                        ourselves on both a conscious and subconscious level has a real impact in our approach, effort
                        and persistence in the face of adversity. If we embrace this challenge as a chance to improve
                        and better ourselves, we open ourselves to a whole new realm of opportunity.
