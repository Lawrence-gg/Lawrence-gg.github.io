                    <p>
                        Being a software developer is all about solving problems. When you are faced with a coding
                        problem, being able to develop a strategy and approach to solve it is an important skill to
                        develop. Sometimes, it can be overwhelming to encounter a task or problem that you haven’t
                        encountered before.

                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        A little while ago I was working on a simple rock paper scissors game as part of some
                        introductory Javascript/HTML and CSS resources. I had managed to get the game working, where you
                        could select Rock Paper or Scissors and play against the computer, who would randomly pick one
                        of the options.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tried to add a feature where the player’s choice and the computers ‘choice’ would both display
                        as pictures. This worked when the player or computer selected rock, but the image would not load
                        for rock or scissors. I tried. And tried again. And tried some more.
                        I went on to google trying to look for if else options for changing pictures. It was pretty
                        frustrating!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It turns out… I had not read the file name correctly. I was trying to link to a place that
                        technically didn’t exist! One capital letter caused a whole bunch of headaches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were two outcomes from this: From then on, I tried to pay much more attention to being
                        consistent with naming conventions. This is a practice I have tried to apply both in file names
                        and when naming variables and functions. I also learned about copying the relative file path in
                        visual studio code. This can highlight other issues, such as if you have accidentally placed an
                        image in a different folder.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        One time I felt pretty satisfied about solving a problem was actually just last night, on code
                        wars. This has a lot of Kata (a martial arts term for practice exercises), to practice problem
                        solving and have some fun doing so.
                        I attempted a question in which you had to make a function that would return the differences of
                        volumes between two cuboids. (the Length, Height and Width).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had recently learned about the .reduce() method, which is a method which takes an array (list)
                        of variables, and does something with it, so I reduced each cuboid to be calculated into the
                        total volume, and returned the difference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although the problem was not overly complex, this was an instance where I recognised a use case
                        for a method, applied it, and had a nice and readable solution to the problem.

                    <p>
                        One of the best investments in the problem solving process is taking a moment to understand the
                        problem. What are you trying to solve? What is the desired outcome? What are the inputs?
                        What are the constraints? Giving yourself a moment to read, process and reflect on the task can
                        help ensure you are approaching
                        the problem in the correct direction.

                    <p>
                        Once you understand the prolem, you might want to start thinking about an approach. What aspect
                        of
                        the problem is the easiest or are you already familiar with?
                        What do you want to work on first to try to get closer to solving it?

                        Pseudocoding
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        For both of these points, pseudocode is a great technique to break down the problem into
                        smaller,
                        more manageable components. This is not actual code, but is a great way to break down the
                        problem into smaller steps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One popular technique to practice your problem solving is to pseudocode some everyday tasks. Say
                        you want to make an omelet? How about making a cup of tea? How would you tell a computer to
                        prepare a bowl of cereal? Why are all my examples about food?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Spanish omelette!</strong>
                    </p>


                    <code class="code" style="display:inline-block">
                        <ul>
                            <li>//Inputs: chopping board, knife, frying pan, stove, ingredients[onions, capsicum,
                                mushrooms, eggs], bowl, cup, fork, butter,plate
                            </li>
                            <li>//Place chopping board on kitchen counter</li>
                            <li>//for (ingedients.length) if they are not eggs: dice on a chopping board and put
                                into a
                                bowl, else crack into
                                a cup and whisk with a fork.
                            </li>
                            <li>//turn on stove and put frying pan on stove</li>
                            <li>//put butter and ingredients from bowl into fry pan, cook 5 mins</li>
                            <li>//pour eggs into fry pan, reduce heat and cover top of fry pan, cook further 5 mins
                            </li>
                            <li>//turn off stove, pick up fry pan and slide omelette onto plate</li>
                        </ul>
                    </code>

                    <p>
                        In a straightforward problem such as this, the pseudocode may seem a bit overkill and silly, but
                        writing a task into ordered, logical steps, is a good way to develop a plan to solve the
                        problem.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps you have never made an omelette before? What if we were to make the problem smaller,
                        more manageable?
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Dividing the problem</strong></p>
                    <p>We can think about this task as a set of smaller, more manageable sub-problems.</p>

                    <code class="code" style="display:inline-block">
                        <ul>
                            <li>//Preparing our ingredients</li>
                            <li>//Heading our frying pan</li>
                            <li>//Executing the cooking</li>
                            <li>//OUTPUT: Cooked omelette</li>
                        </ul>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        This is taking the overall problem and breaking it down into smaller, easier chunks. From there,
                        we can think about
                        what aspect seems easiest or the most simple, and make a start from there.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        I have prepared ingreidents before, so I will start there.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>THEN:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        I have put a frying pan on the stove and turned it on before, so I will do that next.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>And so on.</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        This can be a great approach to make a new task become far more approachable and relative to
                        existing experience and skills.

                    <p>
                        The rubber duck method refers to a method of debugging by taking your code and explaining what
                        it does, line by line, in spoken word. Studies have shown that verbalizing a problem in vocal
                        language line by line is an effective aid in processing and working through problem solving.
                    </p>
                    <p>While the name is called Rubber Ducking, this can be a sympathetic ear such as a co-worker,
                        friend, colleague or even,
                        yes, a literal rubber duck. Quite often the act itself of vocally describing the problem can
                        help bring insight.

                    <p>
                        When writing a piece of code, being able to create and see checkpoints is a great
                        way to trace the flow of your code and what exactly is being returned and executed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Console logging is a great way to add checkpoints in your code and give indicators of what is
                        happening. This is one of the most effective tools when developing code to understand line by
                        line what is happening. This is a method that will return output to the console, without
                        modifying the execution
                        of the code itself.

                        you are not going to be the first person experiencing that problem! Websites like StackOverFlow,
                        programming subreddits, programming blogs, documentations from MDN, Javascript.info, YouTube -
                        There is a mass of information available that you can use to find some direction

                        Stackoverflow is a platform of IT professionals and code enthusiasts to ask and answer questions
                        about the many quirks and nuances of programming and chances are, there is a highly relevant

                        If you are still struggling, you might want to also ask your peers or coaches for some guidance.
                        Sometimes just the act of explaining your problem may have the benefit of giving additional
                        insight. They also are likely to be working or have solved the exact same problem that you are
                        asking about! Additionally, learning from how they have approached a problem or might think
                        about a concept may help to give that ‘A-ha’ moment where it clicks.
