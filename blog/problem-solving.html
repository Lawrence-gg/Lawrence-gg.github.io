                    <p>
                        Being a software developer is all about solving problems. When you are faced with a coding
                        problem, being able to develop a strategy and approach to solve it is an important skill to
                        develop. Sometimes, it can be overwhelming to encounter a task or problem that you haven’t
                        encountered before.

                    <p>
                        One of the best investments in the problem solving process is taking a moment to understand the
                        problem. What are you trying to solve? What is the desired outcome? What are the inputs?
                        What are the constraints? Giving yourself a moment to read, process and reflect on the task can
                        be a massive help.

                        What is the actual problem to solve? What is the desired result or outcome? What are the
                        constraints? Taking the time to read, process and read the problem.

                    <p>
                        Once you understand the prolem, you might want to start thinking about an approach. What aspect
                        of
                        the problem is the easiest or are you already familiar with?
                        What do you want to work on first to try to get closer to solving it?

                        Explain the differences between accessing data from Arrays and Objects
                    </h3>
                    <p>Objects and Arrays are both ways to store collections of data values.

                        In terms of behavior, arrays behave very similar to lists. Lets say you wanted to have a
                        collection of numbers: 1,2, 3 ,4 and 5.</p>
                    <p>You could group these together in an Array Variable. Arrays have a set of square brackets
                        surrounding the structure of data that is held within the array, to group them together.</p>
                    <p>
                        This is stored as a single array object, which you can access the indexes of, to reach a single
                        value stored within the array.<br></p>
                    <code class="code">let numbersArray = [1,2,3,4,5];</code>

                    <p>Objects on the other hand, store data with key:value pairs. This provides flexibility, and
                        <code class="code" style="display:inline-block">
                            <ol>

                                    <li>Turn the kettle on</li>
                                    <li>While waiting:</li>
                                    <li>If cup is not yet prepared, then prepare cup and place on your weird HTML/CSS
                                        table
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Else: Wait patiently for water to boil</li>
                                    <li>Once water has boiled and cup is prepared, pour water into cup</li>
                                    <li>Wait 2.5 minutes</li>

                        multiple pieces of information to be stored within the same variable.</p>

                    <p>This allows for far richer attributes of information attached, such as important details making

                        Explain what functions are and why they are useful
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Functions are like little sets of instructions or mini-programs within your code block to do
                        something.</p>
                    <p>
                        This is a great way to add power and logic into your program, such as a
                        function to add two numbers together that were generated somewhere else in your code. This
                        allows better re-usability and the ability to better organize and make your code more
                        modular.<br>
                        Initially, a function is declared.
                    </p><br>
                    <code class="code">
                        Function addTwoNumbers(a,b) {
                        Return a + b;
                        }
                    </code><br><br>
                    <p>Then, the function is called. </p><br>
                    <code class="code">
                        addTwoNumbers(2,4) // outputs 6
                    </code><br><br>
                    <p>
                        The advantage of this modular instruction being tucked away into its own function is that
                        addTwoNumbers could be called multiple times in different parts of a program, as required.</p>
