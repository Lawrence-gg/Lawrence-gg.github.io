                        <p>Intelligence is a complex and wonderful thing that encompasses many different behaviors with
                            how one processes and manages information. Abstraction, logic, learning, reasoning,
                            creativity, problem solving and critical thinking are all expressions of Intelligence in
                            different formats.
                        </p><br>

                        <p> There is ‘no one size fits all’, and it is difficult to pin down one concrete definition of
                            what makes up intelligence. In this blog, we will explore Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and
                            why it is important to cultivate.

                    <h3 class="blog-subtitle">A look at the differences between EQ and IQ</h2>
                        <p>Quite often, these terms are grouped together or even mistaken for one another. While they do
                            share a lot of similarities, generally IQ is a more narrow-focused view of one’s own ability
                            to take input of information and develop ration, logic, problem solving and analysis to form
                            an output of knowledge. This is observed throughout the animal kingdom and even plants, as
                            we adapt to strategies to better survive and thrive in our environment.<br>
                        </p><br>

                        <p>
                            Emotional intelligence takes this concept and relates it to our ability to form
                            self-awareness, understanding and collaboration with others. Humans are social animals, and
                            our ability to form effective social connections and bond with others is a key essence of
                            our development as a species.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Research shows that many of the strongest factors for success come from emotional
                            intelligence, not intelligence quotient.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>

                            These higher concepts of ‘success-factors’ such as leadership, self-confidence, initiative
                            and influence are built upon core fundamental skills of Emotional Intelligence. Being able
                            to develop trust, to listen effectively, to both appreciate and be liked by others are at
                            the core of this, and are crucial to bond with others and develop a healthy mindset of
                            happiness and fulfillment.

                    <h3 class="blog-subtitle">Techniques to work at improving EQ</h2>
                        <p>
                            Attentive listening, mindfulness and Journal are some techniques to develop and improve
                            emotional intelligence. Mindfulness has been shown to both improve attention and focus, as
                            well as relieve anxiety. Forming a calm and stable sense of one’s self gives a great
                            foundation to be trusting and open with others.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            There are many benefits to improving emotional intelligence, and in today’s working
                            environment being able to work, collaborate and communicate with others is a crucial skill
                            to develop. Hopefully by working at this, we can all improve and just become a little bit
                            better versions of ourselves.
