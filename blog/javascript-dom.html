                    <p>
                        Javascript. The King (or Queen) programming language of the internet. If you’re using the
                        Internet today, you’ll be surrounded by Javascript and it’s many libraries almost everywhere you
                        go, even if you don’t realise it!

                        Javascript brings websites to life by making them interact, update, writable and responsive to
                        the user inputs. This is a key shift away from the early phase of the World wide web, which was
                        largely static (as in you couldn’t do much to interact with it!).

                    <h3 class="blog-subtitle">An Analogy to describe differences between HTML and CSS</h2>
                        <p>HTML is kind of like a blueprint of information. The information and components that make up
                            a structure, without any of the additional details.
                            For example: A table.<br> <br></p>
                        <img src="/blog/blog-article-images/table-picture.png" alt="A picture of a table">
                        <p class="picture-description"><strong>Picture: The table in this story</strong></p>

                        <p>Picture of table
                            Picture: Obviously HTML and CSS
                            What is a table really? A surface top. 4 legs. 4 footers. How does it look? How tall is it?
                            What's it made of? HTML doesn’t know, they have to ask their buddy CSS.</p><br>

                        <p>Where does CSS come in? Our “cascading-style-sheets” give details, styles, and descriptions
                            of what these components are? Is it a teak surface top? A clear glass top? A plastic camping
                            surface with a coffee stain and scratches? Those legs? Black metal or round wood stained
                            pine? I don’t know much about tables. I’m running out of examples.
                        </p>

                    <h3 class="blog-subtitle">Control flow and loops </h3>
                    <p>Computers are… pretty dumb and obedient. Without giving any control flow, the computer will
                        execute instructions, one after another, without waiting or hesitation.<br><br>
                        <strong>Program:</strong><br><br>

                    </p>

                    <p> And DONE. :-) The computer now has a big dumb smile on its face (picture Mark Zuckerberg licking
                        an ice-cream) because it did what you asked it to and in record time too… only 17 milliseconds.
                    </p><br>
                    <p> Control flows give order and direction to how a scope of code will execute:</p><br>

                    <p> Let's make a cup of tea.</p><br>
                    <code>
                        <ol>
                            <p>
                                <li>Fill Kettle with Water</li>
                                <li>Turn the kettle on</li>
                                <li>While waiting:</li>
                                <li>If cup is not yet prepared, then prepare cup and place on your weird HTML/CSS table
                                </li>
                                <li>Else: Wait patiently for water to boil</li>
                                <li>Once water has boiled and cup is prepared, pour water into cup</li>
                                <li>Wait 2.5 minutes</li>
                                <li>Remove Tea Bag</li>
                                <li>Drink</li><br>
                        </ol>
                    </code>
                    <p>In a similar frame, looping is a concept that relies on the computer's obedience. They will
                        do
                        whatever you ask for them, as long as you ask them, until you ask them to stop.
                        There are different types of loops, such as Do While, ForEach, For loops and Recursion among
                        others. <br><br></p>

                    <code>
                        <p>While (tea is not empty) { <br>
                            Take a sip of Tea <br>
                            Wait 2 seconds <br>
                            };<br></p>
                    </code>

                    <p> This would instruct the computer to take a sip of tea, wait 2 seconds, take a sip of
                        tea,
                        wait 2
                        seconds..</p>
                    <p>The exit condition is the cup becoming empty. Only then will the computer move on to
                        the next step.</p>

                    </h3>

                    <p>Up until googling 5 minutes ago I thought the Dom was also the head of the mafia, turns out that
                        is actually called the Don.

                        The DOM is the Document Object Model. Generally, here we will be referring to the HTML DOM,
                        which is kind of like a tree structure containing the layout of the page. This is the structure
                        of information that will be loaded onto a web page.
                        When a page loads, the Document Object will be loaded and displayed on the browser. Javascript
                        can weave its magic here, to make pages dynamic by manipulating elements within the DOM. This
                        could be changing HTML elements, adding css styles, reacting to user input, etc.

                        Explain the differences between accessing data from Arrays and Objects
                    </h3>
                    <p>Objects and Arrays are both ways to store collections of data values.

                        In terms of behavior, arrays behave very similar to lists. Lets say you wanted to have a
                        collection of numbers: 1,2, 3 ,4 and 5.
                        You could group these together in an Array Variable. Arrays have a set of square brackets
                        surrounding the structure of data that is held within the array, to group them together.
                        This is held as a single array object, which you can access the indexes of, to reach a single
                        value stored within the array.
                        [1,2,3,4,5].

                        Objects on the other hand, store data with key:value pairs. This provides flexibility, and for
                        multiple pieces of information to be stored within the same variable.
                        Let person = {
                        name : ‘Lawrence’,
                        Age: 27,
                        LikesCoffee: true
                        }

                        Explain what functions are and why they are useful
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Functions are like little sets of instructions or mini-programs within your code block to do
                        something.
                        This is a great way to add power and logic into your program, such as a
                        function to add two numbers together that were generated somewhere else in your code. This
                        allows better re-usability and the ability to better organize and make your code more modular.

                        Function addTwoNumbers(a,b) {
                        Return a + b;
                        }
