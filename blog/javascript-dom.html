                    <p>
                        Javascript. The King (or Queen) programming language of the internet. If you’re using the
                        Internet today, you’ll be surrounded by Javascript and it’s many libraries almost everywhere you
                        go, even if you don’t realise it!

                        Javascript brings websites to life by making them interact, update, writable and responsive to
                        the user inputs. This is a key shift away from the early phase of the World wide web, which was
                        largely static (as in you couldn’t do much to interact with it!).

                    <h3 class="blog-subtitle">An Analogy to describe differences between HTML and CSS</h2>
                        <p>HTML is kind of like a blueprint of information. The information and components that make up
                            a structure, without any of the additional details.
                            For example: A table. <br>

                            Picture of table
                            Picture: Obviously HTML and CSS
                            What is a table really? A surface top. 4 legs. 4 footers. How does it look? How tall is it?
                            What's it made of? HTML doesn’t know, they have to ask their buddy CSS.

                            Where does CSS come in? Our “cascading-style-sheets” give details, styles, and descriptions
                            of what these components are? Is it a teak surface top? A clear glass top? A plastic camping
                            surface with a coffee stain and scratches? Those legs? Black metal or round wood stained
                            pine? I don’t know much about tables. I’m running out of examples.

                    <h3 class="blog-subtitle">Control flow and loops </h3>
                    <p>Computers are… pretty dumb and obedient. Without giving any control flow, the computer will
                        execute instructions, one after another, without waiting or hesitation.
                        Program:
                        Nowaitiwasntreadbutitisstillexecutingwaitnoslowdownimnotreadybuttheprogramisstillgoing

                        And DONE. :-) The computer now has a big dumb smile on its face (picture Mark Zuckerberg licking
                        an ice-cream) because it did what you asked it to and in record time too… only 17 milliseconds.





                        Control flows give order and direction to how a scope of code will execute:

                        Let's make a cup of tea?!?!

                        Fill Kettle with water
                        Turn the Kettle on
                        While waiting:
                        If cup is not yet prepared, then prepare cup and place on your weird HTML/CSS table.
                        Else: wait patiently for water to boil

                        Once water has boiled and cup is prepared, pour water into cup.
                        Wait 2.5 minutes
                        Remove tea bag
                        Drink

                        In a similar frame, looping is a concept that relies on the computer's obedience. They will do
                        whatever you ask for them, as long as you ask them, until you ask them to stop.
                        There are different types of loops:
                        Do while
                        For Loops
                        For Each

                        While (tea is not empty) {
                        >Take a sip of tea
                        >Wait 2 seconds
                        }

                        This would instruct the computer to take a sip of tea, wait 2 seconds, take a sip of tea, wait 2
                        seconds.. The exit condition is the cup becoming empty. Only then will the computer move on to
                        the next step.

                    </h3>

                    <p>Up until googling 5 minutes ago I thought the Dom was also the head of the mafia, turns out that
                        is actually called the Don.

                        The DOM is the Document Object Model. Generally, here we will be referring to the HTML DOM,
                        which is kind of like a tree of objects. This is the structure of information that will be
                        loaded onto a web page. When a page loads, the Document Object will be loaded and displayed on
                        the browser. Javascript can weave its magic here, to make pages dynamic by manipulating elements
                        within the DOM. This could be changing HTML elements, adding css styles, reacting to user input,
                        etc.

                        If I get stuck on a problem and I cannot manage to find something to ‘unblock myself’ via google
                        (like on Stack Overflow), I will try and communicate with others for help/to see if I am
                        approaching the issue in the right way. Other strategies include taking a short break and coming
                        back to look at the problem with ‘fresh eyes’ to hopefully process and rephrase the issue.
