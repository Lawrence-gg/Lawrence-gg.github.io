                            Kia Ora Everyone,<br>

                            My name is Lawrence and I'm currently living in Wellington. My interests include food,
                            travel,
                            reading and technology. I’m curious about the world we live in and the transformative nature
                            of
                            technology’s impact on our lives.

                    <h3 class="blog-subtitle">A situation where you had an ethical decision to make:</h2>
                        <p>Back in university, we had a project-based paper with a team member who was engaged and
                            dedicated,
                            but very difficult to work with.
                            As the project continued further on, she was becoming increasingly agitated and withdrawn,
                            and
                            had
                            tendencies to voice frustrations on the other group members and our tutor, which was
                            uncomfortable
                            for us and had a bad effect on the group dynamic.<br>

                            After a few instances of this and talking amongst ourselves, we decided to try and find out
                            if
                            there
                            was a different way she would prefer to work that suited her better, to hopefully ease
                            tensions
                            and
                            improve the situation. At the start she was fairly dismissive and not willing to discuss
                            anything.<br>
                            But, as time went on we slowly started to find out she had a really high workload
                            (other demanding
                            papers,
                            work outside of uni, heavily involved in associations taking up her time,
                            financial concerns etc) and was stretched thin and was feeling generally overwhelmed.

                            To ease some of the pressure, we looked for ways to reduce some of the
                            implied workload from our own project by being mindful to keep
                            meetings short and concise and reduce some of her expected tasks.
                            On top of this, we were careful to keep the mood relaxed and easy.<br>
                            While avoiding conflict and without doing anything too drastic, the result was pretty
                            effective.
                            The overall group dynamic improved again and efforts were focused more constructively.
                            <br>
                            Although we never formally addressed it, I think everyone came to an understanding and it
                            helped
                            us
                            have a healthy project outcome as improving the relationship throughout the team.

                        <p>My family has always had an appreciation for travel,
                            as well as curiosity and openness to the world around us and I think that has imparted on my
                            own
                            values.
                            I am very fortunate to have been able to travel from a young age and see how other cultures
                            live.
                            <br>
                            This was a bit of a double edged sword however, as I didn’t really want to settle down after
                            finishing high-school,
                            and I ended up dropping out in my final year, saving up some money and moving to Australia.
                            When I did finally come back however, I felt more ready and motivated and had a strong sense
                            of
                            direction,
                            which has been highly beneficial in moving towards my goals going forward.

                        in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles</h2>

                        <p>I think having some prior life experience is beneficial and an asset, both in terms of
                            personal
                            development, as well as keeping perspective during the course. Over the years I have had a
                            chance to get to know my own style of learning, workflow and identify strategies that work
                            for
                            me.</p>

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            One example that happened pretty recently was actually over this summer break. My girlfriend
                            and
                            I went on a camping trip together down in the South Island and kept finding ourselves
                            arguing
                            and running into conflict about setting up our camp and packing up again. <br>
                            Although it
                            sounds
                            silly writing it out now, we would clash on this and annoy each other.<br>

                            She is someone who values order and keeping things tidy, while I am more free-flowing and
                            pragmatic. We live together at home, and manage to keep an equilibrium there, but somehow
                            this
                            new unfamiliar setting and slightly cramped environment threw our system out of balance.<br>

                            After taking our time to grump, (and get some breakfast and coffee in, which always
                            helps), we
                            talked about how each of us wanted things done and worked out a solution together to respect
                            each other's way of working. <br>We found a much better flow with this and didn’t argue
                            about it
                            again, and the vibes improved considerably as a result. We laughed about the whole thing
                            after,
                            because it seems pretty silly now.
