                    <p>
                        Ideally I would like to be able to ‘have choices’, as in having the ability to be location
                        flexible and able to work fully remotely. I view the tech industry as a fantastic enabler
                        for this lifestyle, as well as being an industry that is constantly evolving and changing.

                    <h3 class="blog-subtitle">A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to
                        learning</h2>
                        <p>A key strength of mine is that I have always enjoyed the process of learning and exploring
                            new concepts and Ideas. Once I find a topic interesting, I really want to explore it and
                            find out more.
                            This has benefits and weaknesses though, and sometimes I have to remind myself to stay
                            organised and focused on a task instead of skimming the surface on a bunch of areas.
                            Something else I am working on is self-comparison to others. I have to remind myself that
                            it's okay when I see someone who is more knowledgeable or further ahead on a learning
                            journey, and accept myself as I currently am.

                        in yourself while at Dev Academy? </h3>
                    <p>I would like to learn to be more accepting and open with myself, and in turn, become a better
                        communicator with others. Also, practising resilience and discipline when the course gets
                        difficult/and or stressful.

                        in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles</h3>

                    <p>I think having some prior life experience is beneficial and an asset, both in terms of
                        personal
                        development, as well as keeping perspective during the course. Over the years I have had a
                        chance to get to know my own style of learning, workflow and identify strategies that work
                        for
                        me.</p>

                        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        If I get stuck on a problem and I cannot manage to find something to ‘unblock myself’ via google
                        (like on Stack Overflow), I will try and communicate with others for help/to see if I am
                        approaching the issue in the right way. Other strategies include taking a short break and coming
                        back to look at the problem with ‘fresh eyes’ to hopefully process and rephrase the issue.

                        Aside from general support, checking in from time to time to make sure everything is okay/voice

                    <p>
                        I am pretty loose on having ‘a strict schedule’, but I generally try and make sure I get a
                        couple of hours of down-time in the evening before bed, as this is important for recharging
                        myself and avoiding burnout.
