            <p>
              Ideally I would like to be able to ‘have choices’, as in having
              the ability to be location flexible and able to work fully
              remotely. I view the tech industry as a fantastic enabler for this
              lifestyle, as well as being an industry that is constantly
              evolving and changing.

              What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be
              in bootcamp
            </h3>
            <p>
              I think I have the capacity to learn and work well with others,
              and have a positive mindset going into the bootcamp.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of challenges, probably shifting my schedule to early
              morning starts, adapting to the long hours and staying ‘on’ for
              that period of time each day will be a challenge, and something to
              stay aware of.

              What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
              will be?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Probably relating to the on-going omicron cases and the
              implication of that. If I test positive and have to isolate
              myself, my situation at home is not ideal due to a construction
              project going on at our complex. This is something I cannot easily
              change however, so I will have to adapt/and or deal with it as
              best possible.

            <p>
              I think learning to work well, get along and collaborate with
              others effectively. This might be in terms of developing a more
              refined sense of being able to contribute ideas / while also
              remaining open to others contributions.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Probably in addition to the regular check ins and code
              help/unsticking, a focus on making things run as smoothly as
              possible given the external circumstances and keeping an open
              communication line with students regarding requirements or
              adaptations with Omicron.

              To try my best. To remain focused. To work hard and keep the goal
              in mind for this brief amount of time. To reach out if I need
              help. To enjoy and embrace the process.

            <p>
              I would like to learn to be more accepting and open with myself,
              and in turn, become a better communicator with others. Also,
              practising resilience and discipline when the course gets
              difficult/and or stressful.

            <p>
              I think having some prior life experience is beneficial and an
              asset, both in terms of personal development, as well as keeping
              perspective during the course. Over the years I have had a chance
              to get to know my own style of learning, workflow and identify
              strategies that work for me.

              way
            </h3>
            <p>
              If I get stuck on a problem and I cannot manage to find something
              to ‘unblock myself’ via google (like on Stack Overflow), I will
              try and communicate with others for help/to see if I am
              approaching the issue in the right way. Other strategies include
              taking a short break and coming back to look at the problem with
              ‘fresh eyes’ to hopefully process and rephrase the issue.

              Aside from general support, checking in from time to time to make
              sure everything is okay/voice any issues or concerns.

            </h3>
            <p>
              I am pretty loose on having ‘a strict schedule’, but I generally
              try and make sure I get a couple of hours of down-time in the
              evening before bed, as this is important for recharging myself and
              avoiding burnout.
