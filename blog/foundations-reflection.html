                    <h3 class="blog-subtitle">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a
                        result of the core learning?</h3>
                    <p>
                        One thing I have taken away from this part of the foundations is the reminder that programming
                        is more than the technology itself, and is probably quite often misunderstood in that aspect.
                        There is a strong concept of collaboration, sharing and empathy that comes into play. This has
                        been demonstrated throughout foundations as we have shared our code, work, knowledge,
                        discoveries and helped others to work through problems and sticking points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another learning has been around the examination of the mindset - and keeping a balanced
                        perspective of growth versus a fixed perspective. This can be simple to look at on the surface,
                        to be mindful, positive and open to learning. Often however, fixed habits can also creep up into
                        the picture unexpectedly as a new skill or concept that is challenging may be daunting and
                        intimidating - it is easy for the ego to shut off to protect itself when this occurs. Learning
                        to recognise when this happens at least a little bit quicker has been one take away, and one
                        habit I will continue to work at.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think lastly, is the takeaway that to gain the most from an experience, you have to
                        participate and be willing to put yourself out there. I often consider myself a bit more on the
                        reserved and introverted side, but learning to open up and collaborate/gain from other’s
                        experiences and knowledge is a real opportunity and pays dividends.

                    <h3 class="blog-subtitle">What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and
                        programming?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I think empathy and self-awareness plays a large part, in effective team building, collaborative
                        solution finding, gaining the most out of learning exercises and forming a rapport with your
                        colleagues. There is a whole lot to gain from people’s individual experiences and strengths.
                        Values play into this as well, by staying true to your own personal ‘core principles’ throughout
                        this: such as treating others with respect, openness, equality and kindness.

                    <h3 class="blog-subtitle">What has surprised you the most about core learning?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Probably the way I noticed my own attitude towards the core aspect of learning change.
                        Initially, there were some traces of resistance, kind of like a “I’m here to learn to code and
                        gain skills to work as a developer, this [core] is interesting but superfluous.” I think as I
                        started to see other’s share their posts and blogs and starting to gain a sense of their
                        perspective, I then started to get a fuller picture of the ‘why’ behind core.

                    <h3 class="blog-subtitle">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I think the step to ‘action’ some of those learnings, such as the listening and looping
                        exercise. I felt a bit self conscious the first time, but then as I put my guard down a bit I
                        ended up enjoying meeting someone from my cohort and learning how they found the assignment
                        exercises.

                    <h3 class="blog-subtitle">Why do you think that we are spending so much time
                        focusing on core learning in a web development course?</h3>

                    <p>
                        There are a few reasons that stick out. Firstly, this is a small mirror of how it will be to
                        work in a professional environment some day. Being able to develop EQ to work with, reflect,
                        collaborate with, navigate personality and idea differences, empathise, listen, manage stress
                        and avoid conflict, offer input and influence and to learn from each other - this list could go
                        on. They are important skills and well worth developing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Secondly, this is meant to be an intensive and transformative process, so managing emotions and
                        thought process in challenging situations is important to improve outcomes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, I think there is an ethos from within Dev Academy of building inclusive, supportive and
                        open teams - and the idea of that leading to better developers/better software in the end by the
                        human and cultural aspect being a strong cornerstone of this.

                    <h3 class="blog-subtitle">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
                        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I don’t think so, no. The introductions have been relatively brief, exploratory and
                        self-directed, so that gives some flexibility to explore and gain perspective and knowledge
                        about some of the concepts that the learner finds interesting/of value. Perhaps, sometimes I
                        have found myself slightly tired of writing blog posts about this or that aspect, such as
                        defining or explaining a term, but the actual learning of the concepts has been valuable and
                        there has been a demonstrated curriculum approach to applying these concepts, throughout
                        foundations so far (and going on throughout bootcamp). I think that is valuable and will help
                        naturally reinforce/practice those learnings.
