                <p>
                    Margin Border and Padding are three core concepts of what is called
                    the 'Box Model'. This is a <strong><em>must-understand</em></strong> for effective
                    web design and layout when building a website. To improve as a web developer, it crucial
                    to have a strong grasp on these concepts. First, we need to make sure we understand what
                    the box model is.

                <h2 class="blog-title">The Box Model</h2>
                <p>What is the Box Model? When Individual elements are created on a website with
                    HTML, they are organized and arranged as <em>Rectangular boxes</em>. Without rules
                    added to make these visible, it doesn't neccessarily appear that way, but these boxes
                    wrap around <strong><em>every single element on the page</em></strong>. On top of this, elements can
                    also have other boxes <em>inside of them</em> or next to them.
                </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    One way to see this in action is to bring up developer tools
                    (<strong>right click + inspect</strong> on
                    Google Chrome). From there, in the <em>styles</em> section, you can search for <strong>"*"</strong>,
                    to target all elements. From there, you can add a <strong>border</strong> property "Border 3px solid
                    red;". This draws
                    an outline around the individual elements and lets you see how they are arranged to make the
                    complete design that you as the end user actually interact with. Pretty Neat!

                        styles.</strong></p>

                <p>As you can see here, we can apply this as a rule to websites to help illustrate their web
                    element lay out and design.

                <p>
                    Finally, you can actually <em>see</em> the box model on developer tools. I like to think about it
                    from an outside
                    in point of view, from the outermost to the innermost aspect.<br><br>
                    The box model uses Margin, Border & Padding to manipulate how the rectangular box is
                    displayed.<br><br>
                    <strong>Margin</strong>: This is space outside of the element. I think of it as distance from
                    <em>other</em> elements, such as a parent box or container.<br>
                    <strong>Border</strong>: As the name suggests, this is a border around the outside edges of the
                    element.<br>
                    <strong>Padding</strong>: This is extra space added <em>within</em> the element. Almost like wearing
                    a big bulky jacket adds padding to your (human) body :-).<br>
                    <strong>Content</strong>: Finally, we have the actual defined content within.
                </p>

                <h2 class="blog-title">Margin</h2>
                <p>Margin Properties create space outside of the element, pushing it <em>away</em> from other content.
                    This can be specified in each direction.<br> For example, if we wanted to create rules to make space
                    6 pixels from the top, 4 pixels from the right, 10 pixels from the bottom and 8 pixels from the
                    left, we could do that as:<br>
                    <strong>Margin-top: 6px;</strong><br>
                    <strong>Margin-right: 4px;</strong><br>
                    <strong>Margin-bottom: 10px;</strong><br>
                    <strong>Margin-top: 8px;</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    Alternately, there is a <em>shorthand</em> where you can declare margin once, and specify the rules
                    from
                    clockwise: <br>
                    <strong>Margin: 6px 4px 10px 8px;</strong><br>
                    This may help you keep your code cleaner and more concise, while providing flexibility!

                <h2 class="blog-title">Border</h2>
                <p>One step in, we have border. This provides ways to specify the style, width and color of an elements
                    border. Among Other Things!</p>
