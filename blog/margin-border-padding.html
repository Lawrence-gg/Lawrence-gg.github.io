                <p>
                    Margin Border and Padding are three core concepts of what is called
                    the 'Box Model'. This is a <strong><em>must-understand</em></strong> for effective
                    web design and layout when building a website. To improve as a web developer, it crucial
                    to have a strong grasp on these concepts. First, we need to make sure we understand what
                    the box model is.
                </p>

                <h2 class="blog-title">The Box Model</h2>
                <p>What is the Box Model? When Individual elements are created on a website with
                    HTML, they are organized and arranged as <em>Rectangular boxes</em>. Without rules
                    added to make these visible, it doesn't neccessarily appear that way, but these boxes
                    wrap around <strong><em>every single element on the page</em></strong>. On top of this, elements can
                    also have other boxes <em>inside of them</em> or next to them.
                </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    One way to see this in action is to bring up developer tools
                    (<strong>right click + inspect</strong> on
                    Google Chrome). From there, in the <em>styles</em> section, you can search for <strong>"*"</strong>,
                    to target all elements. From there, you can add a <strong>border</strong> property "Border 3px solid
                    red;". This draws
                    an outline around the individual elements and lets you see how they are arranged to make the
                    complete design that you as the end user actually interact with. Pretty Neat!
                    <br>

                        styles.</strong></p>

                <p>As you can see here, we can apply this as a rule to websites to help illustrate their web
                    element lay out and design.

                        page.</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Finally, you can actually <em>see</em> the box model on developer tools. I like to think about it
                    from an outside
                    in point of view, from the outermost to the innermost aspect.<br><br>
                    The box model uses Margin, Border & Padding to manipulate how the rectangular box is
                    displayed.<br><br>
                    <strong>Margin</strong>: This is space outside of the element. I think of it as distance from
                    <em>other</em> elements, such as a parent box or container.<br>
                    <strong>Border</strong>: As the name suggests, this is a border around the outside edges of the
                    element.<br>
                    <strong>Padding</strong>: This is extra space added <em>within</em> the element. Almost like wearing
                    a big bulky jacket adds padding to your (human) body :-).<br>
                    <strong>Content</strong>: Finally, we have the actual defined content within.
                </p>

            <article>
                <h2 class="blog-title">Margin</h2>
                <p>Margin Properties create space outside of the element, pushing it <em>away</em> from other content.
                    This can be specified in each direction.<br> For example, if we wanted to create rules to make space
                    6 pixels from the top, 4 pixels from the right, 10 pixels from the bottom and 8 pixels from the
                    left, we could do that as:<br>
                    <strong>Margin-top: 6px;</strong><br>
                    <strong>Margin-right: 4px;</strong><br>
                    <strong>Margin-bottom: 10px;</strong><br>
                    <strong>Margin-top: 8px;</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    Alternately, there is a <em>shorthand</em> where you can declare margin once, and specify the rules
                    from
                    clockwise: <br>
                    <strong>Margin: 6px 4px 10px 8px;</strong><br>
                    This may help you keep your code cleaner and more concise, while providing flexibility!

            <article>
                <h2 class="blog-title">Border</h2>
                <p>One step in, we have border. This provides ways to specify the style, width and color of an elements
                    border. Among Other Things!</p>
                <p>We have already seen what borders can be used for when examining a page's layout.
                    Of course, there are many other uses for borders, such as adding emphasis, styling or giving an
                    outline
                    to elements. Quite often, during development, I will add temporary borders when positioning or
                    manipulating elements
                    to make it easier to see how they look.<br><br>
                    While shorthand is popular using borders, you can also specify to only add a border to
                    <em>one specified side</em> of the element.<br>
                    One example could be:
                    <strong>Border-bottom: 3px solid black;</strong><br><br>
                    <p class="border-example1">Hey look at me I have a bottom border.</p><br><br>
                    <p>Shorthand example:</p><br>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Border: 2px dotted lightcoral;</strong><br><br></p>
                    <p class="border-example2">Hey look at me I have a complete dotted border is it 1999 again i think
                        it is.
                    </p><br><br>

            <article>
                <h2 class="blog-title">Padding</h2>
                <p>Padding is... adding padding <em>within</em> the element. This can expand an item out to give it more
                    presence and
                    give control to setting the size of how items display on a web page. Web Elements such as buttons
                    will frequently
                    add padding to make the button larger than just the specified text and improve useability and
                    accessibility.</p>
                <p>Again, you can use shorthand to give padding in all four directions, or you can specify rules for
                    each
                    specific direction. One thing to consider is that if you have a specified element width, adding
                    padding
                    will extend
                    that element out in both directions. If you have a Box that is 300px and padding that is 25 pixels,
                    the
                    result will
                    be a total of 350 pixels (25px on each side);</p>

            <article>
                <h2 class="blog-title">Outro</h2>
                <p>While this was a highly simplified overview of the Box Model & Margin, Border and Padding, the best
                    way to get better with these concepts is practice! If you aren't comfortable with these aspects yet,
                    I recommend visiting these topics on either W3Schools, or the
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model"> Mozilla
                        Developer Web Docs</a>.<p>After that, you should be well on your way to having a solid
                        understanding and
                        being comfortable using these tools in your own projects going forward!
